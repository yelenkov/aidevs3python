I know I shouldn't be calling about this, but the mood in our brigade is deteriorating. I think it's down to our running out of pineapple pizza. Robots can survive for months without it, but we humans unfortunately cannot. On behalf of the whole team, I would like to request a pizza delivery. We've heard that there is a delivery man in the area named Matthew, who can not only deliver such a pizza to us, but also bake it. Perhaps it would be worth recruiting him to our team.
